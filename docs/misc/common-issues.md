# Common Issues

## Missing Hardware Acceleration Options

The hardware acceleration options listed in the FFMPEG Settings page are derived from output generated by the your configured `ffmpeg` executable. The command used to discover available hardware accel. options is

```
ffmpeg -hide_banner -hwaccels
```

There are a few reasons why your desired hardware acceleration option is not appearing in this list. Here a few of the common ones we've seen:

1. If using Docker, you are not using the appropriate image tag. For instance, if you want to use Nvidia hardware accel, you must be sure to use the `*-nvidia` labeled Tunarr builds. For iGPUs, like Intel GPUs, the `*-vaapi` Docker images are required.
2. The `ffmpeg` executable used by Tunarr is not correct. Double-check the executable path configured by Tunarr with the one in your CLI environment (`which ffmpeg`). One example of this running on Ubuntu and having installed a version of ffmpeg with `snap` (executable in `/snap/bin/ffmpeg`) and one with `apt` (in `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`).
3. The `ffmpeg` executable you are using does not have the necessary libraries compiled in. This can be verified with the hardware accel. command above.

If you've double-checked these things and still are experiencing issues, please open up a [new Q&A discussion topic](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr/discussions/new?category=q-a&title=Missing%20Hardware%20Acceleration%20Option) so we can debug.

## Channel mappings being reset in Plex

If you notice your channel guide is blank, open Plex > Settings > Live TV & DVR > Select "Channels (X) X enabled". If you see something similar to the below screenshot where the dropdowns are blank, your channels have lost their mappings.

You can quickly resolve this by selecting the dropdown on the right and manually re-mapping your channels, but this will not resolve the underlying issue. 

Head over to Tunarr > Settings > SOURCES > Select the pencil icon next to your server > Verify Auto-Update Channels is unchecked.

If this is already unchecked, see [Issue #818](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr/issues/818) to track this issue.
