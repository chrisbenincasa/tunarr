# Common Issues

## Missing Hardware Acceleration Options

The hardware acceleration options listed in the FFMPEG Settings page are derived from output generated by the your configured `ffmpeg` executable. The command used to discover available hardware accel. options is

```
ffmpeg -hide_banner -hwaccels
```

There are a few reasons why your desired hardware acceleration option is not appearing in this list. This is generally only an issue if you are running Tunarr outside of Docker, as Docker images include pre-built FFmpeg binaries with all necessary libraries. Here a few of the common ones we've seen:

1. The `ffmpeg` executable used by Tunarr is not correct. Double-check the executable path configured by Tunarr with the one in your CLI environment (`which ffmpeg`). One example of this running on Ubuntu and having installed a version of ffmpeg with `snap` (executable in `/snap/bin/ffmpeg`) and one with `apt` (in `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`).
2. The `ffmpeg` executable you are using does not have the necessary libraries compiled in. This can be verified with the hardware accel. command above.

If you've double-checked these things and still are experiencing issues, please open up a [new Q&A discussion topic](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr/discussions/new?category=q-a&title=Missing%20Hardware%20Acceleration%20Option) so we can debug.

## Channel mappings being reset in Plex

If you notice your channel guide is blank, open Plex > Settings > Live TV & DVR > Select "Channels (X) X enabled". If you see something similar to the below screenshot where the dropdowns are blank, your channels have lost their mappings.

You can quickly resolve this by selecting the dropdown on the right and manually re-mapping your channels, but this will not resolve the underlying issue. 

Head over to Tunarr > Settings > SOURCES > Select the pencil icon next to your server > Verify Auto-Update Channels is unchecked.

![Auto-update channels disabled](/assets/serversettings-autoupdatechannels.png)

If this is already unchecked, see [Issue #818](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr/issues/818) to track this issue.
