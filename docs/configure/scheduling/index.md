    ---

    Understand how Tunarr's scheduling system works before using the tools.

-   **[Slot Editor](random-slots.md)**

    ---

    Assign programming to "slots" of fixed or dynamic duration, played sequentially or randomly.

-   **[Time Slots](time-slots.md)**

    ---

    Traditional TV scheduling where programs are assigned to specific start times.

-   **[Block Shuffle](block-shuffle.md)**

    ---

    Simpler version of slot editor that randomly chooses "blocks" of programming.

-   **[Cyclic Shuffle](cyclic-shuffle.md)**

    ---

    Cycle through programming in a repeating pattern.

-   **[Replicate](replicate.md)**

    ---

    Create copies of a schedule to play in sequence. Useful as an intermediate step.

-   **[Consolidate](consolidate.md)**
