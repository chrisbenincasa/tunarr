# Scheduling Tools

Tunarr offers a range of tools for scheduling your content.

[Time Slots](/configure/scheduling-tools/time-slots) are the best option to most closely mimic traditional television but can be a bit laborious to configure. 

[Random Slots](/configure/scheduling-tools/random-slots) accomplishes the same as Time Slots, but requires much less work to setup due to randomizing when each show is aired. 

[Balance](/configure/scheduling-tools/balance) let's you pick the weight for your shows to air some shows more frequently than others. 

[Replicate](/configure/scheduling-tools/replicate) will create copies of the same schedule and play them in sequence. This typically is not needed as Tunarr already handles replaying a schedule once complete. 

[Consolidate](/configure/scheduling-tools/consolidate) merges contiguous match flex and redirect blocks into singular spans.
