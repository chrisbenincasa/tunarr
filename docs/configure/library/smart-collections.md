# Smart Collections

Smart Collections are saved searches. They are populated dynamically whenever their contents are queried, as opposed to other types of collections whose contents are static. Smart Collections are created by clicking the save button on the search input.

## Using Smart Collections

Currently, the only way to utilize Smart Collections is to assign them to slots in either Slot Editor or Time Slot Editor. Smart Collection contents are queried at scheduled generation and are used to fill the slot.
