# Custom Shows

!!! info
    Custom Shows will be renamed to "Playlists" an in upcoming release

Custom Shows are akin to classic playlists. Any ordering operations in scheduling tools will use the ordering as defined in the Custom Show. Custom Shows can be schedule as if they were "regular" shows in slot editors. Content within are grouped by the Custom Show and not their _actual_ show. This allows creating more complex groupings of content for use in channels.
