# Clients

Once you have your channels created within Tunarr, you are ready to configure your clients. We currently have a guide written for [Plex](/configure/clients/plex), but [Jellyfin](/configure/clients/jellyfin) and Emby should work as well. You can also utilize generated M3U files with any 3rd party IPTV player app. We recommend [UHF](https://www.uhfapp.com/) for iOS or [Tivimate](https://tivimate.com/) for Android TV.
