Plex should already detect Tunarr and you should see your servers IP address. If you do not, select "Don't see your HDHomeRun device? Enter its network address manually". Use the following format replacing serverIP with your servers IP address; http://serverIP:8000

Once your server is shown, select "Have an XMLTV guide on your server? Click here to use it."

In the "XMLTV GUIDE" field, use the following template replacing serverIP with your Tunarr servers IP address; http://serverIP:8000/api/xmltv.xml

Select "Continue"

Your channels should automatically be mapped. Select "Continue".

Plex should now display your Tunarr channels in the Live TV section. Select "View Guide" to be brought directly there.

Please note, at the time of writing the Plex Windows client is not currently supported and will yield a "This Live TV session has ended" error. Windows users should use the web browser client located at http://serverIP:32400/web until this is resolved.
