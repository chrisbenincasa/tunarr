# Installation

Tunarr is available in two flavors: Docker image and standalone binaries.

## Docker

<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chrisbenincasa/tunarr"><img alt="Docker Pull Count" src="https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/chrisbenincasa/tunarr" /></a>

Tunarr is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chrisbenincasa/tunarr) as well as [GHCR](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr/pkgs/container/tunarr). Docker images come pre-packaged with `ffmpeg` 7.0 (thanks [@jasongdove](https://github.com/jasongdove) from ErsatzTV!).

The general format of tags is: `{release}{-encoder}?`.

Since Tunarr is currently pre-release, there is a single tag: `edge`. The edge tag is pushed hourly from the `main` branch. We also support a specialized image builds which include support for hardware-accelerated encoding with Nvidia, QSV, and VAAPI.

!!! info

    Tunarr has experimental support for QSV / VAAPI. This issue is tracked here: [chrisbenincasa/tunarr#23](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr/issues/23)

Docker:

- `chrisbenincasa/tunarr:edge`
- `chrisbenincasa/tunarr:edge-nvidia`
- `chrisbenincasa/tunarr:edge-vaapi`

GHCR:

- `ghcr.io/chrisbenincasa/tunarr:edge`
- `ghcr.io/chrisbenincasa/tunarr:edge-nvidia`
- `ghcr.io/chrisbenincasa/tunarr:edge-vaapi`

### Unraid

Tunarr is available in the [Community Apps](https://unraid.net/community/apps) store on Unraid. After [installing the Community Apps plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/38582-plug-in-community-applications/) on your Unraid machine, simply search for "tunarr" and select the resulting app (provided by grtgbln's repository).

Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the container, including mapping the Web UI port. You can optionally pass in an Nvidia GPU or Intel iGPU for hardware transcoding (use the proper corresponding Docker tag; enable "Advanced View" for more details), and optionally map an existing dizqueTV configuration directory to migrate (click "Show more settings...").


## Binaries

Tunarr is released in pre-built binaries for Windows (x64), macOS (x64), and Linux (x64).

Like Docker images, we currently have a single release, `edge` that updates hourly.

Prebuilt binaries can be found at [https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr/releases/tag/edge](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr/releases/tag/edge)
