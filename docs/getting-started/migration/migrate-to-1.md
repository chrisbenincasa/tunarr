# Migrating from 0.22.x to 1.x

If you ran Tunarr before 1.0, you can still upgrade directly to the 1.x line! However, there are some things to consider:

1. There are _many_ breaking changes between these versions.
2. Like Tunarr release that contain breaking changes, rolling back is not supported.

We recommend taking a **full backup** of your Tunarr data directory before upgrading to 1.x. Should something go wrong with your upgrade, or you experience an issue only present in 1.x and wish to revert, you can restore your backup for 0.22.x.
