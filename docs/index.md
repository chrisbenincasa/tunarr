# Tunarr

Create live TV channels from media on your Plex/Jellyfin servers, and more!

Configure your channels, programs, commercials, and settings using the Tunarr web UI.

Watch your channels by adding the spoofed Tunarr HDHomeRun tuner to Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby. Or utilize generated M3U files with any 3rd party IPTV player app.

## What is this?

Tunarr was originally a fork of [**dizqueTV**](https://github.com/vexorian/dizquetv) (which in itself was a fork of other projects!) which evolved into a near-complete rewrite. This project was born out of both a love for TV and an appreciation for the work put into dizqueTV and its predecessors.

Tunarr has the following goals:

- Modernize the stack, both backend and frontend
- Stabilize the program, fix bugs, and improve performance
- Modernize and "prettify" the Web UI
- And of course, **add a ton of great new features!**
